"""Application funnel — turns per-job application_status counts into a Sankey graph.

Single status field limitation: a job stores only its *current* stage / outcome,
not the full path it took. So we reconstruct flows along a canonical funnel tree
using "cumulative reach": a node's inflow = jobs sitting at that node + all jobs
that advanced beyond it.

Canonical tree (parent → children):

    Applied
      ├─ Awaiting          (status: applied — in pipeline, no response yet)
      ├─ Rejected          (status: rejected)
      ├─ Ghosted           (status: ghosted)
      ├─ Withdrew          (status: withdrew — candidate declined / withdrew)
      └─ Round 1           (status: round_1)
         ├─ No Advance     (status: no_advance — interviewed, did not progress)
         └─ Round 2        (status: round_2)
            └─ Round 3      (status: round_3 — "3")
               ├─ Pending   (status: pending — awaiting decision)
               └─ Offer     (status: offer)
                  ├─ Offer Accepted  (status: offer_accepted)
                  └─ Offer Declined  (status: offer_declined)

`not_applied` is excluded from the funnel (the candidate hasn't applied yet).
