## Experience

### Cloud Infrastructure Engineer — Freshworks *(2023 – Present)*

AWS Infrastructure Automation
Provisioned and maintained production AWS infrastructure for ClickHouse analytics platform (60 TB+, 200+ servers) entirely via Terraform
Designed reusable Terraform modules for EKS clusters, VPCs, IAM roles, Route53 zones, ACM certificates, S3 buckets, Auto Scaling Groups, Security Groups
Implemented tiered storage architecture: ClickHouse TTL policies move cold data from EBS to S3; local EBS caching for hot data — reduced storage costs substantially
S3 cross-region replication for DR: hourly ClickHouse backups replicated across regions; automated restore workflows; improved RTO from hours to minutes

Infrastructure Cost Engineering
Built AWS Cost Explorer + Lambda aggregation pipeline for per-tenant infrastructure cost visibility
Delivered cost dashboards to engineering and leadership for infrastructure spend optimization
Designed hot/cold storage tiering strategy reducing storage costs without impacting query performance

Kubernetes on AWS
Deployed EKS clusters with Karpenter for node lifecycle management (on-demand + spot blending)
Configured IRSA for workload-level IAM, ALB Ingress Controller, ExternalDNS with Route53 automation
Managed ClickHouse platform lifecycle: upgrades, capacity planning, performance benchmarking across versions

CI/CD & Automation
GitHub Actions pipelines: infrastructure plan/apply automation, ECR image sync, Helm validation
Python automation: tenant provisioning, manifest generation, ArgoCD deployment integration
Built remote data migration framework: ClickHouse Remote Functions for customer cluster onboarding; Route53 cutover procedures

Reliability
Designed and executed DR framework: automated backups, cross-region replication, snapshot recovery
Owned on-call for infrastructure incidents; built SOPCTL automation for faster incident resolution
