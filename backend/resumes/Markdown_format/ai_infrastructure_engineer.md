## Experience

### Infrastructure Engineer, AI Workloads — Freshworks *(2023 – Present)*

Infrastructure for AI & Data Services
Provisioned and operated EKS infrastructure (Terraform + ArgoCD GitOps) hosting MCP servers, LLM-assisted tooling, and data services at 200+ servers / 60 TB+ scale
Built CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for validation, ECR image sync, and automated deployment of AI/data services

Compute Scheduling & Performance
Tuned Kubernetes CPU Manager with dedicated physical-CPU pinning for compute-intensive workloads, reducing CPU throttling ~90% and improving performance ~2×
Implemented Karpenter autoscaling to scale compute elastically and cost-efficiently for large analytics/AI workloads

AI Tooling on the Platform
Built MCP servers (FastMCP/MetaMCP) and an LLM incident assistant (Temporal) running on the platform — query-pattern analysis, alert correlation, RCA generation
Built an AI developer-tooling platform (provisioning Cursor/Claude/Kiro) with usage analytics and a credit-wallet metering system

Data Infrastructure & Storage
Operated the ClickHouse/MongoDB data platforms feeding analytics and AI workflows, with cross-region DR and PITR
Implemented hot/cold tiered storage (EBS → S3) to scale infrastructure cost-efficiently for large datasets; improved query performance ~40%

Reliability & Cost
Standardized GitOps delivery, reducing manual operational toil ~70%
Drove ~30% AWS cost reduction via instance right-sizing and autoscaling
