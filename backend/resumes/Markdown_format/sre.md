## Experience

### SRE / Platform Engineer — Freshworks *(2023 – Present)*

Reliability & Incident Response
Owned on-call rotation for ClickHouse platform serving 60 TB of analytics data across 200+ servers
Reduced CPU throttling by ~90% by implementing Kubernetes CPU Manager static policy for ClickHouse workloads
Built SOPCTL incident assistant integrating Slack alerts → Temporal workflows → automated SOP execution → LLM-generated RCA, accelerating incident resolution
Designed DR framework: hourly ClickHouse backups, S3 cross-region replication, automated restore workflows; improved RTO from hours to minutes

Observability
Deployed full observability stack: Prometheus, Grafana dashboards, AlertManager rules (PromQL), Node Exporter, Elastic + Kibana for centralized log aggregation
Integrated Slack alerting for proactive incident detection; reduced MTTD significantly
Built AWS Cost Explorer + Lambda pipeline for per-tenant infrastructure cost visibility

Kubernetes Platform Operations
Provisioned and operated production EKS clusters on AWS with Terraform (VPC, IAM, Route53, ACM, S3, ASG, Security Groups)
Configured ArgoCD GitOps pipelines; deployed Karpenter, Gatekeeper, ExternalDNS, ALB Controller, ClickHouse Operator
Migrated entire deployment framework from Kustomize to Helm; improved maintainability and reduced deployment variance
Optimized ClickHouse SELECT query performance by ~40% through Lazy Materialization evaluation

Automation & CI/CD
Built GitHub Actions workflows for Helm validation, ECR image sync, automated release tagging, ArgoCD deployment updates
Developed Python-based tenant provisioning: dynamic manifest generation for ClickHouse, ZooKeeper, and Envoy; ArgoCD integration eliminated manual onboarding
