## Experience

### Kubernetes Platform Engineer — Freshworks *(2022 – Present)*

Cluster Design & Operations
Provisioned and operated multi-tenant EKS clusters on AWS for ClickHouse analytics platform (60 TB, 200+ servers)
Terraform-automated full AWS stack: VPC, Security Groups, IAM roles, Route53, ACM, S3 buckets, Auto Scaling Groups
Deployed and managed: Karpenter for node lifecycle, Gatekeeper for OPA policy enforcement, ExternalDNS, ALB Controller, ClickHouse Operator, ZooKeeper
Migrated deployment system from Kustomize → Helm umbrella charts; standardized values-based multi-environment config

GitOps & Release Automation
Operated ArgoCD as the sole deployment mechanism across all environments; enforced GitOps discipline
Built GitHub Actions pipelines: Helm schema validation, automated ECR image sync, release tagging, ArgoCD deployment triggers
Implemented remote migration framework using ClickHouse Remote Functions for customer data onboarding; Route53 cutover automation

Operator Development
Led full migration from Percona MongoDB Operator → custom Community MongoDB Operator (CSMDB)
Rewrote reconciliation logic for sharding management, backup workflows, PITR, resource lifecycle
Built integration tests and E2E coverage; Jenkins CI pipeline for operator builds

Performance Tuning
Benchmarked Kubernetes CPU Manager policies for ClickHouse; static CPU allocation reduced throttling by ~90%
Evaluated ClickHouse Lazy Materialization feature; improved SELECT query performance by ~40%
Implemented tiered storage (EBS → S3 via TTL policies + local EBS cache) reducing storage costs while maintaining query performance

Observability
Full Prometheus + Grafana + AlertManager deployment; custom PromQL rules and Slack alerting
Elastic Stack + Kibana for centralized log aggregation across cluster workloads
